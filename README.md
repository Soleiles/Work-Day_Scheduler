# Work-Day_Scheduler

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a time reponsive schedule calender using jQuery and Day.js. We needed to utilize local storage in order to be able to view previously entered data. Using Day.js, I was able to actively able to recieve the exact date and time of day and have my webpage respond accordingly.

This project has helped me have a better understanding of the usage of jQuery and Day.js.
